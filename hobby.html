              I know this is kind of an odd question because you can't really
              force yourself into a hobby, but I sometimes have spare time and I
              just want the mindset of: "Man I can't wait to go home and work on
              x or do some programming" I am sure that I want to go into a
              career as a software developer. However I wouldn't say that I
              practice a lot in my spare time (which I should). Right now I'm
              only a freshman, but I really want to get myself into a good
              position for future prospects. I originally chose CS because I've
              always been around computers and I love them. I've tried
              self-taught programming in the past but always gave up as it was
              pretty difficult to learn without an instructor for me. I feel
              like I enjoy programming when I know what I'm doing, but when I
              don't know how to do something I get pretty frustrated and
              uninterested. I don't know any full languages yet, but we are
              learning C++. Anyway I think it's important for me to actively
              learn to enjoy programming, because otherwise I'm just wasting my
              spare time. Does anyone have any experience with this? I want to
              be able to do this now so I have the will-power to keep learning
              when I move into my career. Also because it's rad as hell being
              able to create things that can do anything you want (within
              reason).

              Why You Need to Make Travel Your Hobby ?
            </h3>

            <p>
              Sometimes living in America you get the feeling that you don’t
              have to travel around the world to see other cultures and places,
              because if you look around practically all of us are from
              different cultural background and ancestry, and if you look for
              food in the street, you’ll see all kinds of restaurants offering
              various kinds of food: from Chinese, French, British, Italian to
              Spanish and Mexican. But as for me, all of this diversity makes me
              feel like I want to check its authenticity and see the countries
              with my own eyes. Some of us indeed like to try out new things,
              get to know people from around the world, etc., but still you may
              not like travelling because of the headache it brings: like
              getting your suitcase ready, buying tickets, standing in airport
              queues, getting flight or sea sickness or changing time zones with
              all that it implies. Once I had to travel quite often to my home
              country to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, because my dad happened to be
              very ill and needed someone to care for him. So I got used to
              travelling a lot in a very short period of time. And
              irrespectively of sad memories connected with my father’s illness,
              I fell in love with travelling and now nothing can stop me from
              visiting my family in Haiti, not even flight, passport or baggage
              hassle associated with travelling. As you may have already
              guessed, today I am going to tell you about my favorite hobby,
              which is travelling, and in particular, I’ll be telling you more
              about my trips to Haiti and why I actually enjoy them so much.
